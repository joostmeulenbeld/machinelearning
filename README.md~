MNIST

TODO:

	- live plotting of training and validation error
	- saving of network weights/parameters
	- convergence detection (stop training when converged)
	- routine for optimizing/bruteforcing network sizes/nonlinearities
		check for number of epochs at convergence, error rate, training time
	- output predicted label as well directly in theano, compute true or false
		should be faster computationally (and teaches me more theano expressions)
	- convolutional neural network
