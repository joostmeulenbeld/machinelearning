MNIST

TODO (not in order of importance):
	- live plotting of training and validation error
	- more robust settings system
	- convergence detection (stop training when converged)
	- routine for optimizing/bruteforcing network sizes/nonlinearities
		check for number of epochs at convergence, error rate, training time
	- output predicted label as well directly in theano, compute true or false if correct
		should be faster computationally (and teaches me more theano expressions)
	- convolutional neural network
	- live plotting of the probability distribution?
		makes for very fancy videos!
	- refactor network in superclass (neuralnetwork) and subclass (fullyconnected or CNN)
